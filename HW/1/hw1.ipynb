    "### Why Choose Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strong Interpretability: Logistic regression provides outcomes (like probabilities) that are easy to interpret, aiding in identifying factors more likely to lead to fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary Classification Suitability: Logistic regression is a classic method for binary classification problems, perfectly fitting this scenario.\n",
